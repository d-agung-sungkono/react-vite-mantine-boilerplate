# React Vite Mantine Boilerplate

## Description
The **React Vite Mantine Boilerplate** is a ready-made development framework designed to help developers quickly build websites that combine both a landing page and a content management system (CMS) or admin dashboard within the same project. This boilerplate simplifies the development process by providing a pre-configured structure with essential features already in place.

### Key Features
- **Pre-built layout slicing**: The layout structure is already divided and prepared, allowing you to focus on content rather than layout design.
- **Role-based protected routes**: The routing system is configured to protect certain routes based on user roles (e.g., admin, regular users), ensuring security and proper access control.
- **Multi-language support**: The project is pre-configured to handle multiple languages, making it easy to localize your website for global users..
- **State management setup**: State management is already integrated, providing a solid foundation to manage the application’s state efficiently.
- **Reusable components**: A variety of commonly used UI components are included, so you can build your project faster without writing everything from scratch.
